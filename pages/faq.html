                    <p>
                        Is Bika LIMS really free?<br>
                        &emsp;There are no license fees, the code base is achieved <br>
                        &emsp;through the foresight of clients who want to see their <br>
                        &emsp;investment hardened. Labs source services, configuration,<br>
                        &emsp;training, support from their preferred providers, in-house<br>
                        &emsp;or contracted <br>
                        <br>
                        Can we install Bika LIMS on our own servers?<br>
                        &emsp;Sure, onsite or server farm of your choice<br>
                        <br>
                        What do we get?<br>
                        &emsp;Full ownership. Bika LIMS is Free and Open Source, users<br>
                        &emsp;have full ownership and access to their code, sans licence <br>
                        &emsp;fees or vendor lock-in . Bika can be used by unlimited users<br>
                        <br>
                        Where's the catch?<br>
                        &emsp;LIMS is complex and you'll likely require assistance with <br>
                        &emsp;configuration and using it,interfacing Instruments.<br>
                        &emsp;We recommend taking out professional support for prioritised <br>

                        <br>
                        How do we get better SEO visibility using Open Source?<br>
                        &emsp;Through participation on public forums and user groups <br>
                        &emsp;indexed by search engines and hosting Bika on your own <br>
                        &emsp;domain. Sponsors of new features get big exposure, in the <br>
                        &emsp;community and through news Items and press releases<br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which Hardware? <br>
                        &emsp;Best practice is a dedicated LIMS server running <br>
                        &emsp;Debian or Ubuntu. Quad core i7, 64GB RAM, 2 * 248GB SSD in RAID. <br>
                        &emsp;Thin browser-only workbench PCs. Zebra desktop label printers and <br>
                        &emsp;Symbol barcode scanners are robust and good value<br>
                        <br>
                        How does Senaite relate to Bika LIMS?<br>
                        &emsp;Bika LIMS, 2002 to 2017, is the Senaite foundation. Bika 4 design <br>
                        &emsp;focussed on performance and maintainability became Senaite to <br>
                        &emsp;resolve the naming issue of the project and founding company both <br>
                        &emsp;using the same title, unfair to other participants<br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp;Bika Lab Systems, Cape Town, contributes to Senaite, but <br>
                        &emsp;the bulk originates in Europe today. With near 20 years invested, <br>
                        &emsp;we maintain the Bika brand independently, providing add-ons <br>
                        &emsp;to extend the generic Senaite base with functions extra to its <br>
                        &emsp;lean performance driven scope<br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp;In the spirit of Ubuntu, Bika strives for a more holistic <br>
                        &emsp;delivery model and value professionalism and honesty, telling <br>
                        &emsp;it as it is<br>

                    <p>
                        Where can we save?<br>
                        &emsp;Most Bika and Senaite professionals do server installations at<br>
                        &emsp;discounted prices in order to grow the project. Big configurations<br>
                        &emsp;can be done from spreadsheets. Instrument results files can be <br>
                        &emsp;converted to a generic format for import<br>
                        <br>
                        Why are more labs not using Open Source LIMS?<br>
                        &emsp;Unfamiliarity - labs do not realise they can have tailor made<br>
                        &emsp;industrial strength LIMS this affordably. FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and<br>
                        &emsp;Doubt, a disinformation strategy by proprietary business<br>

                        So is it any good?<br>
                        &emsp;Professional Open Source, POS, has become better than <br>
                        &emsp;closed systems, for all its inherent benefits unmatched in proprietary<br>

                        The Bika UIX sucks<br>

                        &emsp;front designed by usability experts, raise the bar and cannot be <br>

                        What does ‘Bika’ mean?<br>
                        <br>
                        &emsp;Bika is an isiZulu word, pronounced ‘beekah’ and means ‘to report’.<br> 
                        &emsp;It was chosen in the ethnic heyday of Ubuntu Linux, replacing the <br>
                        &emsp; eurocentric Bach its foregoing prototype for wine laboratories<br>
